# ORB Analysis

Status: Planning

Here’s what we can read from the 30‑minute dataset you shared (≈101k candles for BTC/USDT and ETH/USDT spanning 1 Jan 2020 → 9 Oct 2025). Each session produces one ORB candle, so we have 2 108–2 109 ORB samples per session (per symbol).

### **Baseline hit rates (US session)**

| **target** | **direction** | **opportunities** | **hit %** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1_bull | up | 2 108 | 63.9% |
| L1_bear | down | 2 108 | 63.2% |
| L2_bull | up | 2 108 | 50.0% |
| L2_bear | down | 2 108 | 50.0% |
| L3_bull | up | 2 108 | 30.0% |
| L3_bear | down | 2 108 | 32.0% |
| prev_day_high | up | 2 108 | 39.0% |
| prev_day_low | down | 2 108 | 33.2% |
| prev_week_high | up | 2 108 | 30.0% |
| prev_week_low | down | 2 108 | 19.0% |

(As expected, orb_high/orb_low are always “hit” — they’re the candle’s own high/low.)

### **Long-side edges (target L1_bull, US session)**

Dwelling on the ORB characteristics you mentioned:

| **Condition** | **Hit %** | **Sample size** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any ORB candle | 63.9% | 2 108 |
| Bullish close AND close ≥ ORB mid | **70.0%** | 878 |
| Doji that closes ≥ mid | **77.2%** | 123 |
| Hammer (flag is_hammer) | 71.3% | 80 |
| Tiny body (bottom quartile) with dominant lower wick | **72.7%** | 304 |
| Bearish close below mid (avoid) | **55.2%** | 891 |

So the high-probability “long” recipe that emerges is: tiny-bodied doji/hammer with a dominant lower wick, closing back above the ORB mid. That subset trades into L1_bull between 70–77% of the time over the 2 108 US samples.

### **Short-side edges (target L1_bear, US session)**

| **Condition** | **Hit %** | **Sample** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any ORB candle | 63.2% | 2 108 |
| Bearish close AND close < ORB mid | **68.8%** | 891 |
| Bearish with dominant upper wick | **69.4%** | 447 |
| Bearish doji that finishes below mid | **69.5%** | 82 |
| Large body bearish candle | **68.0%** | 272 |
| Bullish close above mid (avoid) | **56.5%** | 878 |

That mirrors the long case: when the ORB candle closes under its midpoint, shows an upper-wick bias (or is a “failure” doji), the first downside extension is tagged roughly 69% of the time. Conversely, if the candle is bullish and closes back above mid, the short idea drops to 56%.

### **Asia session comparison (30 m data)**

To check robustness, here are the same high-level conditions in Asia:

| **Condition (target L1_bull)** | **Hit %** | **Sample** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Any ORB candle | 59.5% | 2 109 |
| Bullish & close ≥ mid | 65.3% | 910 |
| Doji close ≥ mid | 65.4% | 104 |
| Tiny body with lower-wick dominance | **69.3%** | 277 |

So the pattern of “small candle + lower wick + recovery above mid” still pushes the edge higher even in a different session, albeit with a lower base rate (Asia volatility is lighter → base hit rate 60% vs 64%).

### **Takeaways for a scalping framework**

1. **Define opportunity as a high-probability ORB signature, not every row.** Use the features above (bull/bear close, close vs mid, wick dominance, pattern flags, body size quartiles) to filter.
2. **Focus on the first extension (L1).** L2/L3 and previous-day/week levels exist but the hit rate drops into the mid-40s or worse. That’s a different trade with longer hold time.
3. **Combine conditions.** The best edges came from intersecting two or three traits (e.g., “bullish + close ≥ mid + lower wick dominant”).
4. **Beware small sample flags.** Hammers/donjis are great, but you only get 80–205 occurrences over 5+ years. They’re still meaningful but supplement them with broader conditions.
